# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a modern Next.js application that provides a dashboard for monitoring and controlling the robot arm system.

## Development Setup

- Uses **bun** as the JavaScript/TypeScript package manager ([package.json](mdc:frontend/package.json))
- Installation: `cd frontend && bun install`
- Run development server: `bun run dev`
- Build for production: `bun run build`

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework with server-side rendering
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn/UI**: High-quality UI components

## Directory Structure

- [frontend/src/app/](mdc:frontend/src/app) - Next.js application pages
  - Page-based routing with React Server Components
  - API routes for client-side communication

- [frontend/src/components/](mdc:frontend/src/components) - Reusable UI components
  - UI building blocks for the dashboard
  - Specialized components for robot control visualization

- [frontend/src/lib/](mdc:frontend/src/lib) - Utility functions and helpers
  - API client for backend communication
  - WebSocket integration for real-time updates
  - Data formatting and transformation

## Key Features

- Pipeline management (list, start, stop)
- Configuration editing
- Signal control with different priority levels
- Real-time frame visualization
- Status monitoring of active pipelines

## Communication with Backend

- REST API calls for basic operations (list pipelines, start/stop)
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Image streaming for visualization of camera feed and detection results
